    "Inheritance is a way to organize classes that are related in terms of the data they hold or their functionality.  Child classes inherit attributes from their parents, so we don't have to recreate the same functionality in different places.  If we have to update a particular attribute, we usually only have to do that in one place.  Inheritance also helps us think about how classes are related, since a child class will generally extend or specialize the functionality of a parent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see how inheritance works by performing some simulations.  Simulation is a great place to start using classes, because each class has a real-world counterpart, which makes it easy to think about.  For example, we previously designed our drone class by thinking about the properties of a real-world drone.  As we will see later, object-oriented programming requires us to move past such easy analogies to more abstract classes.  For now, however, we will continue to work with simulations as an easy way to build up our familiarity with classes."

    "In particular, let's use a class to represent a discrete-time stochastic process.  A stochastic process can be thought of as a single variable that changes over time.  It may help to think of the price of a stock over time, or measurements of solar radiation, or the average planetary surface temperature.\n",
    "\n",
    "For every modeled time t, a stochastic process has a value, which is a real number.  A discrete process proceeds from each integer time t to time t + 1.  This process may be deterministic or probabilistic, depending on the process.  As object-oriented programmers, we might immediately think about a time_step() method to represent this process."
