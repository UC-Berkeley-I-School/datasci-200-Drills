    "- Overall numbers for 2019 and 2020 in these categories:\n",
    "  - Intake for cats & dogs\n",
    "  - Outake for cats & dogs\n",
    "  - Comparison of 2020 vs 2019 both in numbers and a percent\n",
    "  - Make this a table so you can present it to your boss & other stakeholders\n",
    "- Did data quality improve from 2019 to 2020?\n",
    "- Anecdotally, during 2020 it seemed like everyone was adopting new pets - does this show in the data?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Some considerations about the dataset:\n",
    "- In 2020, the collection requirements and process changed in an attempt to improve data quality. This also caused the column names to be slightly different between years. \n",
    "- You can combine the files into one but this isn't necessary; both approaches have different problems to solve!"
