    "### Drills Note:\n",
    "- These drills/exercises are designed to give you more practice with Python and to help bridge the difficulty between the async and the homework assignments. They are optional but highly encouraged as a lot of programming skill comes from a certain familiarity and repetition with the code!\n",
    "- The drills are run on datahub (a berkeley server). Since the server is running a Linux environment, use the Linux commands below. Also, all of the commands are run on the server so the output might not look like the information below. You can download a notebook to your computer and run it locally if you prefer. Also all of the notebooks and solutions are in the course materials repository:  https://github.com/UC-Berkeley-I-School/datasci-200-Course-Materials (if you don't have access to that repo please email the course coordiantor!)\n",

    "### This exercise notes:\n",
    "- To better understand what you have installed with the Anaconda distribution that you installed lets do some exploring. In order to run command line processes through this notebook we will preface the commands with \"!\". The \"!\" uses the IPython shortcut to launch command line processes. Because Jupyter notebooks use the IPython interpreters, we are able to do this, but it will not work with all python interpreters.\n",
    "- The following is the exploration and output on my machine. Run the same commands on your machine and modify them if necessary. \n",
    "- Since command line commands are different on Mac/Linux vs Windows, both commands are given (in separate blocks).\n",
    "  - If you are running this notebook from the link, it is hosted on the datahub servers. Use the Linux blocks to run code there!\n",
    "  - You can also download the notebook and run it from your local computer. If you do that, please use the cell with the commands of your computer's operating system.\n",
