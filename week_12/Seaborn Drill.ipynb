    "### Python and Plotting\n",
    "Plotting data is facilitated using a number of tools - python's own drawing tools and a many libraries & plug-ins. In this drill, we explore a number of plot actions for a basis and then integrate data that you manipulate with numpy and pandas.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Helpful Tools\n",
    "There are lots of helpful tools and demos in GitHub, some of which have been used in this drill set.  Some most common plotting examples: bar plot, scatter, line plots, histograms, and (others).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why visualize?\n",
    "The main points of visualizing data is to communicate to the viewer (a) trends in the data, group membership (and when a member of one group intersects with another), unusual \"events\" or \"interesting events\" that warrant futher investigation, and an understanding of both the big picture of the data and the subsets (or clusters, classifications) that collectively tell a compelling story.  Adding interactivity either programmatically moving the data over a timeline or letting the user select details-on-demand really underscores the communicative goal of your cool programming."
